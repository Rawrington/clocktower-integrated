# Splatter on the Wall, Client

Based on the React Vite template, this is the source for my discord integrated clocktower client! Licensed under GPL 3.0 with some code sourced from the wonderful [townsquare](https://github.com/bra1n/townsquare/) project.

## Features

Currently, feature parity with clocktower.online is being achieved but some cool features include:
- Full, required discord communication, involving a hosted server that sends relevant data back and forth about the state of discord to the client.
- Role setup and assignment, seating based on discord invites.
- Full sync with game state, incase of unexpected issues.
- Official AND Custom script support!

### Planned major features

- Implementation of features relevant to the app with 'special' support from the official script schema.
- Full night visitation help for the storyteller
- Spectators
